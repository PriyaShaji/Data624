### Load required packages{.tabset}

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kernlab)
library(mlbench)
library(caret)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
```

#### 7.2

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/priyashaji/Documents/cunymsds/Data 624/week 11/Screen Shot 2020-11-03 at 5.09.19 PM.png")
```

- After loading the dataset, convert the 'x' data from a matrix to a data frame


```{r}
set.seed(200)
trainingData <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
## We convert the 'x' data from a matrix to a data frame
## One reason is that this will give the columns names.
trainingData$x <- data.frame(trainingData$x)
## Look at the data using
featurePlot(trainingData$x, trainingData$y)
```

- creating a list with a vector 'y' and a matrix of predictors 'x'. Also simulating a large test set to estimate the true error rate with good precision:

```{r}
## or other methods.
## This creates a list with a vector 'y' and a matrix
## of predictors 'x'. Also simulate a large test set to
## estimate the true error rate with good precision:
testData <- mlbench.friedman1(5000, sd = 1)
testData$x <- data.frame(testData$x)
```


Tune several models on these data. For example:

Tuning Knn Model:

```{r}
knnModel <- train(x = trainingData$x,
                  y = trainingData$y,
                  method = "knn",
                  preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                  tuneLength = 10)
knnModel
```

- Using function 'postResample' to get the test set perforamnce values

```{r}
knnPred <- predict(knnModel, newdata = testData$x)

## The function 'postResample' can be used to get the test set
## perforamnce values
postResample(pred = knnPred, obs = testData$y)
```

<strong>Which models appear to give the best performance? Does MARS select the informative predictors (those named X1-X5)?</strong>

<strong> Answer</strong>

Now, we are going to build different models whose datasets are scaled and centered for model building.

<strong>SVM</strong>

Tuning a SVM model with method as `svmRadial` 

```{r}
svmRadialModel <- train(x = trainingData$x,
                        y = trainingData$y,
                        method = "svmRadial",
                        tuneLength=10,
                        preProc = c("center", "scale"))
svmRadialModel
```


Function used for resampling is `postResample`. After a model is tuned, the test set performance is calculated.


```{r}
svmRadialPred <- predict(svmRadialModel, newdata = testData$x)
postResample(pred = svmRadialPred, obs = testData$y)
```

RMSE for SVM is 2.0864652.

<strong>Averaged Neural Networks</strong>

Now, let's tune the model using `averaged neural networks` over decay and number of hidden units.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nnetGrid <- expand.grid(.decay=c(0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9),
                        .size=c(1, 10, 15, 20),
                        .bag=FALSE)

nnetModel <- train(x = trainingData$x,
                   y = trainingData$y,
                   method = "avNNet",
                   tuneGrid = nnetGrid,
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                   trace=FALSE,
                   linout=TRUE,
                   maxit=500)
```

Displaying model results:

```{r}
nnetModel
```

Function used for resampling is `postResample`. After a model is tuned, the test set performance is calculated.

```{r}
nnetPred <- predict(nnetModel, newdata = testData$x)
postResample(pred = nnetPred, obs = testData$y)
```

RMSE for averaged neural networks is 1.894755.

<strong>Mars</strong>

Using `Mars` method to tune our model by earth method:

```{r}
marsGrid <- expand.grid(.degree=1:2,
                        .nprune=2:20)

marsModel <- train(x = trainingData$x,
                   y = trainingData$y,
                   method = "earth",
                   tuneGrid = marsGrid,
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"))
```


Displaying results for model:


```{r}
marsModel
```

Using function `postResample` to resample our model:

```{r}
marsPred <- predict(marsModel, newdata = testData$x)
postResample(pred = marsPred, obs = testData$y)
```

RMSE for `MARS` model is 1.2779993.

As per the RMSE of above three models, MARS model has lowest RMSE of 1.277 and it fits best compared to other two models.

Let's display informative variables picked by MARS model using `varImp` since it has best fit and also lowest RMSE.


```{r}
varImp(marsModel)
```


the MARS model picked the most informative variables, X1 ~ X5.


#### 7.5

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/priyashaji/Documents/cunymsds/Data 624/week 11/Screen Shot 2020-11-05 at 7.41.30 PM.png")
```

Before beginning with analyses, let's impute the missing data.

In the `ChemicalManufacturingProcess` dataset, missing data points are imputed using the bagImpute method.

```{r}

library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(ChemicalManufacturingProcess)
# Impute missing values using `bagImpulte`
(cmpImpute <- preProcess(ChemicalManufacturingProcess[,-c(1)], method=c('bagImpute')))

```

Splitting the dataset in to test and train

```{r}

cmp <- predict(cmpImpute, ChemicalManufacturingProcess[,-c(1)])

# Train/test plitting data, 20% testing
set.seed(1)
trainRow <- createDataPartition(ChemicalManufacturingProcess$Yield, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
X.train <- cmp[trainRow, ]
y.train <- ChemicalManufacturingProcess$Yield[trainRow]
X.test <- cmp[-trainRow, ]
y.test <- ChemicalManufacturingProcess$Yield[-trainRow]
```


In this question, I will train non-linear models and display their resamlped data together as a list.

Now, lets train KNN model

<strong>KNN</strong>

Tuning KNN model:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
knnModel <- train(x = X.train,
                  y = y.train,
                  method = "knn",
                  preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                  tuneLength = 10)
```

Displaying results for KNN model

```{r}
knnModel
```


<strong>averaged neural networks</strong>


Tuning averaged neural networks model:


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nnetGrid <- expand.grid(.decay=c(0, 0.01, 0.1),
                        .size=c(1, 5, 10),
                        .bag=FALSE)
set.seed(1)
nnetModel <- train(x = X.train,
                   y = y.train,
                   method = "avNNet",
                   tuneGrid = nnetGrid,
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                   trace=FALSE,
                   linout=TRUE,
                   maxit=500)
```


Displaying results for averaged neural networks model:


```{r}
nnetModel
```


<strong>MARS</strong>

Tuning MARS model:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
marsGrid <- expand.grid(.degree=1:2,
                        .nprune=2:10)
set.seed(1)
marsModel <- train(x = X.train,
                   y = y.train,
                   method = "earth",
                   tuneGrid = marsGrid,
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"))
```


Displaying results for MARS model


```{r}
marsModel
```


<strong>SVM</strong>

Tuning SVM model using radial bias method:


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
svmRadialModel <- train(x = X.train,
                        y = y.train,
                        method = "svmRadial",
                        tuneLength=10,
                        preProc = c("center", "scale"))
```


Displaying results for SVM model


```{r}
svmRadialModel
```


<strong>(a)</strong>


The resampling performance of all the models are calculated below:

```{r}
resamp <- resamples(list(KNN=knnModel, NNet=nnetModel, MARS=marsModel, SVM=svmRadialModel))
summary(resamp)
```


By seeing the above RMSE, SVM model has lowest RMSE compared to others. Therefore, SVM model is optimal.

Now we will calculate test set performance:

```{r}
testPerf <- function(models, testData, testTarget) {
  method <- c()
  res <- data.frame()
  for(model in models){
    method <- c(method, model$method)
    pred <- predict(model, newdata=testData)
    res <- rbind(res, t(postResample(pred=pred, obs=testTarget)))
  }
  row.names(res) <- method
  return(res)
}

models <- list(knnModel, nnetModel, marsModel, svmRadialModel)

performance <- testPerf(models, X.test, y.test)
performance
```

Test set performance models RMSE is lowest for SVM model.

Displaying SVM models results:

```{r}
(svmModel <- svmRadialModel$finalModel)
```


<strong>b</strong>


For fitted neural network model, there is no direct method to caculate most important predictor, the following list is computed from SVM model.

The `varImp` function with which we get the important variables of a model, it evaluates variable importance by fitting a loess smoother between the outcome and the predictors giving us R^2 metric for variable importance.


```{r}
topFeatures <- varImp(svmRadialModel)
topFeatures
```

As we see from the above results, out of first 10 predictors, 6 predictors are ManufacturingProcess predictors.

ManufacturingProcess32 is top ranked predictor. Therefore, it seems that ManufacturingProcess are more important predictors compares to BiologicalMaterial.


<strong>c</strong>

- Exploring relationship between tp predictors and response for predictors. 

- Extract the support vectors determined by the model and sort the top features       determined by loess R^2

```{r}

vectorIndex <- SVindex(svmModel)
supportVectorX <- X.train[vectorIndex,]
supportVectorY <- y.train[vectorIndex]


topFeatures <- topFeatures$importance
topFeatures$predictor <- row.names(topFeatures)
topFeatures <- topFeatures[order(topFeatures$Overall, decreasing = T), ]
topFeatures <- row.names(topFeatures)


for (i in 1:10){
  plot(x=supportVectorX[, topFeatures[i]], y=supportVectorY, 
       xlab=topFeatures[i], ylab='Yield')
}
```


As we see, above scatter plots show relationships between predictors of the SVM model and the response variable Yield
.

- As we know there are 122 support vectors in the SVM model, I extract those and plotting these vectors with the top 10 variables ranked by the loess R^2 method.

- We can infer from the plots, that top features have significant relationship with the target variable.

- In ManufacturingProcess32 plot we can see that, as the variable value increases,Yield also increases
